## Usage

Configure API credentials for Fitbit and Google: See the code.


### First time: Get credentials

Authenticate user by running:

```
node fitbit-interface.js
```

and doing as it says. Access tokens have now been acquired with which the program can run autonomously, and push notifications have been initiated.


### Automatic sleep log synchronization

Start the server:

```
node fitbit-sleep-to-google-calendar.js
```

When it receives a posh notification, it pulls todays sleep data and creates a calendar event.


### 'Manual' sleep log synchronization (no push notifications)

Create calendar events for all sleep events from `2015-12-31` to current date:

```
node fitbit-sleep-to-google-calendar.js 2015-12-31
```

*Duplicate events are never created.*
